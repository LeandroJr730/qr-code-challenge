## My process

I watched 2 youtube courses from BroCode talking about HTML and CSS and that's where most of my knowledge about "coding" comes from.<br>
I didn't use flexbox or stuff like that because I tried to make the project only using what I have learned in the past, that is positions, margins, padding, transform, etc.<br>
My procces was like this: Main box first (adjusting background-color and estimated size), then I included the paragraphs (modifying the font, color, padding...), and to finsih I added the image (rearraning the position tags, and sizes).<br>
The most difficult part for me was to guess the sizes of the things, like the width of the box, the border-radius of the image, the padding of the paragraphs...


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

I had to recap some previous studies and I had to search about some stuff that I forgot how to do, like how to center a div :P<br>
In general the project was very fun to me, but of course I still need to improve a lot!


### Continued development

I need to learn how to develop sites to display in all types of screen sizes.<br>
I also need to learn about flex box, web layouts, and stuff like that. With these I think the code would probably be smaller and better.


### Useful resources

- [HTML course by Bro Code](https://youtu.be/HD13eq_Pmp8?si=pglN9YQTjD3QjHkq) - This is where I learned HTML.
- [CSS course by Bro Code](https://youtu.be/wRNinF7YQqQ?si=_h30mo2lqqrMOsP3) - This is where I learned CSS.<br>
I sincerely recommend Bro Code, he is a very good teacher, but he has an uptated full course for HTML and CSS, which I will watch later to improve and learn more: -[HTML & CSS Full Course for free ðŸŒŽ (2023)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGTJBPNC-Gw&list=PLpQDGz0Hs_AXPawmuvP0zT2c3V0Tuoc27&index=12&t=945s).
